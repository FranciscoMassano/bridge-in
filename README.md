## Brief Note

in src/helpers/constants.tsx you can find a const to define how many pages of request the application processes, since the free API request is throttled this is necessary, if you have a paid version you can change the value up to 5000.

### `npm install`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
